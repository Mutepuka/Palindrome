# Palindrome
Simple PHP application that checks if the word entered is the same when spelled backswards.
To set up the application you will need to set up a localserver because the application is using php which is a server based language. I recommend you download a local server XAMPP. You can download it from this link https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
